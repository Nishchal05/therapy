        <ul>
            <li class="list1">Light Therapy (Phototherapy)</li>
            <p><h3>Discription:Light therapy is a treatment that involves exposure to artificial light at controlled wavelengths to treat a variety of medical disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD) with seasonal patterns (formerly known as seasonal affective disorder, or SAD), circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders, cancers, and skin wound infections. It is also known as phototherapy or bright light therapy</h3></p>
            <p><h3>Study:According to a study, light therapy was effective in improving symptoms of depression when used alone or with fluoxetine, an antidepressant medication. It works by exposing you to an artificial light source that mimics natural sunlight, which can help regulate your biological clock, balance the activation of serotonin circuitry in your brain, and contribute to stable and consistent sleep patterns.</h3></p>
            <li class="list1">Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT)</li>
            <p><h3>Discription:Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) is a type of psychotherapy that combines cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) with mindfulness techniques. It was originally developed to treat borderline personality disorder (BPD), but has since been adapted to treat other mental health conditions such as depression, anxiety, eating disorders, and substance abuse.</h3></p>
            <p><h3>Study:Studies have shown that Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) can be an effective treatment for depression. In one study, participants who trained in DBT-related emotional regulation and mindfulness had a significant reduction in depressive symptoms. Another study’s results also supported the idea that participation in DBT training can be an effective way to help those with major depressive disorder (MDD) .</h3></p>
            <li class="list1">Art Therapy</li>
            <p><h3>Depression is a common mental health condition that can be treated with art therapy. Art therapy can help people with depression to express their emotions and feelings in a non-verbal way . It can also help them to develop new coping skills and gain personal insight .</h3></p>
            <p><h3>study:A pilot study of improved psychological distress with art therapy in cancer patients showed that art therapy improved the emotional distress, depression, anxiety and pain among all cancer patients, at all time points . Another study showed that art therapy for cancer patients could enhance the vitality of patients and participation in social activities, significantly reduce depression, anxiety, and reduce stressful feelings .</h3></p>
            <li class="list1">Sleep Hygiene Therapy</li>
            <p><h3>Sleep hygiene refers to healthy sleep habits that can help you get a good night’s sleep and improve your overall quality of life. Good sleep hygiene is important because of how crucial getting good sleep is for your mental and physical health. Your behaviors during the day — not just before you go to bed — can affect how well you sleep.</h3></p>
            <p><h3>study:Sleep hygiene is an important aspect of maintaining good sleep habits and improving your overall quality of life. A study on college students found that sleep hygiene played a direct role in improving depression and feelings of overall well-being. Research has linked sleep disturbances to increased risk of anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, and active suicidal behavior.</h3></p>
